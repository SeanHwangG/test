> Question

* Given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i, j)
* Rain starts to fall. At time t, depth of water everywhere is t
* Can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent iff elevation of both squares individually are at most t
* Can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within boundaries of grid during your swim
* Return the least time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if start at the top left square (0, 0)

```txt
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3

Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
