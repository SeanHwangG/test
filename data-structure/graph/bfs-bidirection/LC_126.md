> Question

* Transformation sequence from word begin to word end using dictionary wordList is sequence of words begin, s1, ..., sk st:
  * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
  * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that begin does not need to be in wordList.
  * sk == end
* Given two words, begin and end, and dictionary wordList, return all shortest transformation sequences from begin to end
* Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [begin, s1, s2, ..., sk].

```txt
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
