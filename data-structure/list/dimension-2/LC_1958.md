> Question

* You are given a 0-indexed 8 x 8 grid board, where board[r][c] represents cell (r, c) on a game board
* On board, free cells are represented by '.', white cells are represented by 'W', and black cells are represented by 'B'
* Move is only legal if, after changing it, cell becomes endpoint of a good line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
* Good line is has three or more cells (including endpoints) where endpoints are in once color, and remainings are opposite
* Given two integers r, c and player color (white or black), return if move is legal
