> Question

* given n projects where ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and min capital of capital[i] is needed to start it
* Starts with w capital. When finish project, obtain its pure profit and profit will be added to your total capital
* Pick at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize final capital, and return final maximized capital

```txt
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
