* User

  | Users_Id | Banned | Role   |
  | -------- | ------ | ------ |
  | 1        | No     | client |
  | 2        | Yes    | client |
  | 3        | No     | client |
  | 4        | No     | client |
  | 10       | No     | driver |
  | 11       | No     | driver |
  | 12       | No     | driver |
  | 13       | No     | driver |

* Write a SQL query to find cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver)
* Dividing # of canceled (client or driver) requests with unbanned users by total # requests with unbanned users on a day
* Return the result table between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". in any order. Round up to two decimal points

| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
