# Software Engineering

> Term

* Prototyping: creating prototypes of software applications ([ex] incomplete versions of the software program being developed)
  * activity that can occur in SDE, comparable to prototyping as known from other fields, [ex] mechanical engineering manufacturing
* breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases
  * where each phase depends on the deliverables of previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks
* KISS principle: simplicity should be a key goal in design

## Code Review

* should avoid API discussion: should happend before code is written
* Automated as possible: Linter and CI
* Readability: Type, function and variable name
  * complex code should be commented
  * Important actions should be logged
* Side effect: Function should be as pure as possible
* Limits
  * Null, singular case
  * Unexpected / Large input from user

## Extreme Programming

* development methodology to improve software quality, responsiveness to changing customer requirements

> Term

* YAGNI: programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary

## Agile

* Paradigm involve discovering requirements, developing solutions with self-organizing, cross-functional teams and end users

* Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles
  1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
  1. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
  1. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
  1. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
  1. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
  1. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
  1. Working software is the primary measure of progress
  1. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
  1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
  1. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
  1. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
  1. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
