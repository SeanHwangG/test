> Question

* Given intersection of two roads
* First road is road A where cars travel from North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2
* Second road is road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in direction 4

```txt
Input: cars = [1,3,5,2,4], directions = [2,1,2,4,3], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,50]
Output: [
"Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.
"Car 3 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1",    // Car 3 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
"Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2",    // Car 5 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
"Traffic Light On Road B Is Green",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.
"Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.
"Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3"     // Car 4 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.
