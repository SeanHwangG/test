> Question

* An attendance record for a student can be represented as string: 'A': Absent / 'L': Late / 'P': Present
* Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
  * The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
  * The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
* Given n, return # possible attendance records MOD 1e9 + 7 of length n that make student eligible for attendance award

```txt
Input: n = 2
Output: 8  # "PP", "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
```
