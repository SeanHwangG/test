> Question

* Sequence is special if it consists of + number of 0s, followed by a + number of 1s, then + number of 2s
* For example, [0,1,2] and [0,0,1,1,1,2] are special.
* In contrast, [2,1,0], [1], and [0,1,2,0] are not special.
* Given array nums (only integers 0, 1, and 2), return the number of different subsequences that are special MOD 109 + 7.

```txt
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3  # The special subsequences are [0,1,2,2], [0,1,2,2], and [0,1,2,2].
```
