> Question

* In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people
* The ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has
* Sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there should be a person with that skill
  * We can represent these teams by the index of each person
* Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person in any order

```txt
Input: req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]
Output: [0,2]

Input:
req_skills = ["algorithms","math","java","reactjs","csharp","aws"],
people = [["algorithms","math","java"],["algorithms","math","reactjs"],["java","csharp","aws"],["reactjs","csharp"],
  ["csharp","math"],["aws","java"]]
Output: [1,2]
