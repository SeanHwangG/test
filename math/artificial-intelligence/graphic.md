# Graphics

> Terms

* Interactive
  * Produces images within milliseconds
  * Using specialized hardware, graphic processing units
  * Standardized APIs (OpenGL, DriectX, Vulkan)
  * Tries to be as photorealistic as possible
  * Hard shadows, only single bounce of light
  * Used in games, technical design

> Rendering

* Synthesis of a 2D image from a 3D scene description
* 2D image is an array of pixels
* Algorithm interprets data structures that represent scene in terms of geometric primitives, textures, and lights
* Objective / Interactive

> Shadow

![Shadow](images/20210214_020943.png)

* hard shadow is generated by point source while soft shadow generated by extended source
* Stereo
  * shape from shading (single image, known direction, known BRDF)
  * Photometric stereo (single viewpoint, multiple images under different lighting)
* Multi-view stereo
  * Multiple images, dynamic scene, multiple viewpoints, fixed lighting, correspondence hard

## Light

| Equation        | Type                  | Property                                                |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ k*(p-v)^2 $$ | Quadratic attenuation | Most computationally expensive, most physically correct |
| $$ k*(p-v) $$   | Linear attenuation    | Less expensive, less accurate                           |
| $$ k $$         | Constant attenuation  | Fastest computation, least accurate                     |

* Sources - point, distant point, strip, area
* all the light leaving a point is due to that arriving at that point
* surfaces don't fluoresce (scorpions, detergents)
* surfaces don't emit light

* reflected: mirror
* transmitted: skin, glass
* scattered: milk
* absorbed: travel along the surface and leave at some other point

> Terms

* BRDF (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function)
  * Given light direction, viewing direction, how much light is reflected to viewers
* Global Illumination: Multiple bounces of light / Computationally expensive
* Local Illumination: Only one bounce of light between light source and viewer
* Per-Triangle shading: Evaluate shading once per triangle, based on normal vector / Faceted appearance
* Gouraud shading: Interpolates vertex colors across triangles
* Per Pixel shading  Phong Interpolation: Rasterizer interpolates normals across triangles and evaluated at each pixel

> Photorealistic

* Physically-based simulation of light, camera Shadows, global illumination, multiple bounces of light
* Slow, used in movies, animation
