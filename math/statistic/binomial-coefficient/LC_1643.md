> Question

* Bob is standing at cell (0, 0), and he wants to reach destination: (row, column). He can only travel right and down
* You are going to help Bob by providing instructions for him to reach destination
* The instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either:
  * 'H', meaning move horizontally (go right), or
  * 'V', meaning move vertically (go down).
* Multiple instructions will lead Bob to destination
  * For example, if destination is (2, 3), both "HHHVV" and "HVHVH" are valid instructions.
* Bob has a number k, and he wants kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. k is 1-indexed
* Given array destination and k, return kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will take Bob to destination

```txt
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 1
Output: "HHHVV"

Input: destination = [2,3], k = 2
Output: "HHVHV"
```

    else:
