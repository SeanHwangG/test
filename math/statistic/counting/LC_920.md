> Question

* Player contains n different songs. You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip
* To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:
  * Every song is played at least once.
  * A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.
* Given n, goal, and k, return # possible playlists that you can create, MOD 109 + 7.

```txt
Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 6  # [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].

Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
Output: 6  # [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
```

> Solution

* Last song might be new / old
