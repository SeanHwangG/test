> Question

* There are duplicate folders in a file system
* given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in file system
* Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical
  * if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure
  * folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical
  * If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.
* Return 2D array ans containing paths of remaining folders after deleting all marked folders (in any order)

```txt
Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]

Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
